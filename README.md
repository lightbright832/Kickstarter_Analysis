# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Kickstarter campaigns are a great way to fund art projects without placing all of the burden on the creator. A kickstarter campaign will allow creators to raise the funds for projects while focusing on creating content. This project provides a glimpse into several kickstarter campaigns that were intended to raise money for various theater plays. Some of the campaigns were a success while some failed at meeting their goal. The data provided will help to identify trends that may have contributed to the success or failure of the campaign.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help tell the story of these campaigns by formatting data into a form that is easier to understand. By formatting the data in such a way it makes it possible to highlight trends and outliers. Implementing data visualization helps to remove unnessary information while highlighting what is most useful for decision making. Louise will be able to use this analysis as a starting point when she embarks on her next campaign. 
## Analysis and Challenges
This was an interesting project to take part in because it provided a lot of exercise in using Excel spreadsheets. Excel spreadsheets can house a wealth of data that may prove to be useful in decision making. For this challenge the data was already compiled which made it easier to add additional worksheets. Instead of starting from scratch I simply followed the instructions that were provided to create pivot tables that were later used to create line charts. A pivot table allows users to manipulate the data so that the most important information will be highlighted. When you apply this type of sorting and filtering it makes visualizations more effective in telling a story. During the challenge I did run into an issue when trying to use the COUNTIFS function because I was not placing the <= in the right order. If this is not done correctly the formula will not pull the correct information. Once I realized where I was making my error completing the rest of the table was successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the visualizations that were produced from this project it is important to note that much of the success for the campaigns occured during the summer months. May, June, and July provided 298 successful campaigns. As the year ends it is aparent that the success rates of the campaigns dropped off as well. While May had the most successful campaigns launched it also had the most failed campaigns. This may be due to the fact more campaigns were launched during this time so the numbers could have went either way. It is necessary to dive deeper into the specifics of the campaigns that failed during this peak time. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

A kickstarter campaign can set a goal of any amount. It is up to the creator to determine what type of budget is needed to produce the project. Based on these figures the kickstarter campaign may be a success or a failue. From the results of the analysis it is clear to see that as long as the budget was between $1000 and $4999 the campaign typically was a success. As the goals for each campaign became higher the number of failures increased. There were very few campaigns that had goals of more than $20,000. This is partly due to the inability to reach goals of this magnitude. The sweet spot for a campaign is setting a goal of at least $1,000 but no more than $15,000. By raising the goal amount the is more of a chance of missing the goal.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge did not produce very many challenges as the modules made the process seamless. There were occassions where I struggled with getting the formulas input correctly but after reading over the Excel documentation these errors were eliminated. The most burdensome aspect of the challenge was the amount of time that was needed for completion. On several occassions I had to stop working on the analysis so that I could get other tasks accomplished. Overall this kickstarter challenge was enlightening and enjoyable to complete.
## Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* It is not wise to launch a campaign at the end of the year
* Most campaigns are successful in the summer months

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* I can conclude that as long as the campaign does not have a goal that exceeds $15,000 there is a high probablity that the campaign will be a success
* It is not a good idea to set large goals because historically they have failed

What are some limitations of the dataset?
* The data does not give any indicator of how well known the creators of the project are
* More popular creators may see more success than those who are new to the art world
* It would be beneficial to know the reach of each campaign to determine why it succeeded or failed

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
* Tables showing the success rate of similar campaigns from the same creator
* Graphs showcasing the income levels of the audience being marketed to for the campaign
* Graphs highlighting the education level of the target audience
